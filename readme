personal leetcode project in C language.

It's impossible to new a cmake project for every Solution, so, I put them together into the folder `solutions`.

# Environment

Debian11 WSL
lastest cmake, gcc

VSCode
extensions:
ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
ms-vscode.cmake-tools
ms-vscode.cpptools

## Build

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
